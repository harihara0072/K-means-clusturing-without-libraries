Python Version: 
Python 3.6 

Libraries Version: 
Numpy – 1.14.3 
Matplotlib – 2.2.2 

Code Explanation: 
The code can be explained in following steps. 

Data reading: 
First, we need to load the data set into two numpy arrays called x_matrix and y_matrix 

Initialize Centroids: 
Then as the value of k mentioned by the user, we need to generate the initial points of centroids. Here I took the min and max value of each dimension as the range of random number generated. 

Calculate the Euclidian distance: 
Then, we need to calculate the Euclidian distance between each data point to each cluster and assign each point to nearest cluster. 

Change the cluster to new location: 
Once we have the points assigned to each cluster then we need to move the centroid to the center of all the points under that cluster. 

Repeat: 
Repeat this whole process for 300 times to get the best possible solution
 
Calculation of accuracy: 
Once we have all the points to centroid, science the data we have is a labelled data we can calculate the accuracy by seeing how many points are wrongly classified. 

How to run the code: 
1. Place the text file with the data in the same location 
2. Run the file Main.py with k value as the parameter 
Python Main.py <k-value>
